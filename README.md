# 7-Segment_Arduino
Key Features:
LED Arrangement: The seven LEDs are arranged to resemble the shape of the number "8". 
Segments: Each LED is called a segment and is labeled with letters "a" to "g". 
Decimal Point: An optional eighth LED can be used to display a decimal point. 
Displaying Numbers and Letters: By selectively illuminating different segments, you can display numbers (0-9) and some letters (like "A", "C", "H", etc.). 
Common Cathode and Common Anode: There are two main types of 7-segment displays: common cathode (where all cathodes are connected) and common anode (where all anodes are connected). 
Arduino Interfacing: You can easily interface 7-segment displays with Arduino boards by connecting the segments to the Arduino's digital pins. 
Applications: 7-segment displays are commonly used in digital clocks, calculators, electronic meters, and other devices that display numerical information.
